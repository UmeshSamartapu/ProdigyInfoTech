# Neural Style Transfer 🎨

**Neural Style Transfer** — applying the artistic style of one image (like a famous painting) onto another image (the content image) using deep learning.

Both a Jupyter notebook for experimentation and a **Web Application** for user-friendly interaction are included.

## 🚀 Features

- Transfer the artistic style of one image onto another using **VGG19** pretrained model.
- Fine control over **content weight** and **style weight**.
- Intermediate outputs saved during optimization.
- Web Application to **upload your own images** and get a styled output easily.
- Saves output images and a GIF showing the progress.

---

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1. Notebook Version (Google Colab or Local)

- Upload the directory structure to Google Drive.
- Open `Neural Style Transfer.ipynb` in Colab.
- Mount your Google Drive:
  ```python
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  !pip install torch torchvision pillow imageio
  ```
- Run the cells to start style transfer.

### 2. Web Application (Computer)

- Navigate to the web app folder.
- Install required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Run the web server:
  ```bash
  python app.py
  ```
- Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
- Upload a **content image** and a **style image** to generate your styled image.

## 📦 Libraries and Frameworks Used

- **PyTorch** (Deep Learning Framework)
- **TorchVision** (Pretrained VGG19 Model)
- **PIL** (Image Processing)
- **ImageIO** (GIF generation)
- **Flask / FastAPI** (Web Application)
- **HTML/CSS** (Frontend)

## ✨ Output Samples

- Saved output images at different iterations (every 100 iterations).
- Final stylized image.
- A GIF showing the transformation progress.

---

## 🤝 Credits

- Inspired by the paper ["A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Leon A. Gatys et al.
- Pretrained model: **VGG19** from torchvision.

---

## 🔥 Future Improvements

- Support multiple style blending.
- Faster style transfer with lightweight models like **Fast Neural Style Transfer**.
- Deploy the web app online using **Render** or **Heroku**.
