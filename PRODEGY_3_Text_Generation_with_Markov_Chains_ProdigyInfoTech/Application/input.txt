The Renaissance period (14th-17th centuries) marked a cultural rebirth in Europe following the Middle Ages. Beginning in Italy and spreading northward, this era saw renewed interest in classical philosophy, literature, and art. Humanism emerged as an intellectual movement emphasizing human potential and achievements. Artistic innovations included perspective in painting and realistic sculpture. Major figures included Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael. The invention of the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg around 1440 helped spread new ideas. While often portrayed as uniformly progressive, the Renaissance actually progressed at different rates in different regions, with many areas remaining largely medieval in character throughout the period. The era laid the groundwork for the scientific revolution and Enlightenment that followed.
